Each folder is about each topic
to run code you must install nodejs and typescript in your machine

simply goto each folder and run `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm start` to compile and run in single go.

running step by step:
`npm run build` to compile ts files(you can also do it manually `tsc <ts-file-name>`)
`npm run exe` to run compiled js file (you can also run it manuallt `node <js-file-name>`)
